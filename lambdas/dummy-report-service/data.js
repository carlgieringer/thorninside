    "about": "The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) was incorporated in 1984 by child advocates as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization to serve as a national clearinghouse and resource center for families, victims, private organizations, law enforcement, and the public on missing and sexually exploited child issues. To further our mission to help find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation, and prevent future victimization, NCMEC operates the CyberTipline and makes information submitted to the CyberTipline available to law enforcement and also uses this information to help identify trends and create child safety and prevention messages. As a clearinghouse, NCMEC also works with Electronic Service Providers, law enforcement and the public in a combined effort to reduce online child sexual abuse images. NCMEC is not an agent or instrumentality of the government or law enforcement agency and does not act in the capacity of or under the direction or control of a government or law enforcement agency. NCMEC does not investigate and cannot verify the accuracy of the information submitted by reporting parties.",

To further our mission to help find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation, and prevent future victimization, NCMEC operates the CyberTipline and makes information submitted to the CyberTipline available to law enforcement and also uses this information to help identify trends and create child safety and prevention messages. As a clearinghouse, NCMEC also works with Electronic Service Providers, law enforcement and the public in a combined effort to reduce online child sexual abuse images. NCMEC is not an agent or instrumentality of the government or law enforcement agency and does not act in the capacity of or under the direction or control of a government or law enforcement agency.

To further our mission to help find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation, and prevent future victimization, NCMEC operates the CyberTipline and makes information submitted to the CyberTipline available to law enforcement and also uses this information to help identify trends and create child safety and prevention messages. As a clearinghouse, NCMEC also works with Electronic Service Providers, law enforcement and the public in a combined effort to reduce online child sexual abuse images. NCMEC is not an agent or instrumentality of the government or law enforcement agency and does not act in the capacity of or under the direction or control of a government or law enforcement agency.
